# Heterogony of ends
Welcome! My name is Augusto Dalla Ragione. I'm a fresh HSE Moscow graduate who loves demography, geography and maps. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AugustoRagione) or connect with me through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/augusto-dalla-ragione-2119271b1/).

This is a space where I share data visualizations and maps I create using R, with their respective code to ensure reproducibility.
